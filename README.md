avg-speed
=========

Microcontroller software and hardware design for calculation of the average speed of a car.

A integrator sums up the speed at a given sampling rate. The value is divided by the number of samples to compute the average speed.

A reset button restarts the integrator such that a new average is created from that point in time.
